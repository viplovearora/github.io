### Action-based Modeling of Complex Networks

- Devised a generative model that utilizes first principles to synthesize realistic networks
- Combined various decision processes for localized node interactions to synthesize realistic network topologies
- Formulated the problem of parameterizing action-based network generators as a non-linear inverse problem
- Utilized the action-based framework to design resilient supply chain networks in a centralized fashion
- Combined geometric and non-geometric wiring rules to explain topological organization of the connectome

### Action-based Stochastic Block Model

- Devising a generative model that can accommodate the micro and macro-level structures of networks
- Combine Bayesian inference in SBM with the action-based model in a hierarchical manner

### Generative Modeling and Variability in Network Populations
    
- Highlighted the need for evaluating and incorporating natural variability in generative models for networks
- Developed data-driven entropy measures for explicit quantification of variability in network populations
- Developing alternative formulations for statistical inference from multiple network observations

### Network Design for Resilience

- Designed networks capable of maintaining sufficient performance when subjected to adverse circumstances
- Formulated centralized and decentralized approaches for enabling better-informed network design decisions
- Devised a framework for designing individual incentives for agents in strategic network formation games
- Automated mechanism design to devise player incentives to achieve global design goals
