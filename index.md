I am Viplove Arora, postdoctoral researcher working on machine learning in Bioinformatics in the [The Theoretical and Scientific Data Science Group](https://datascience.sissa.it/) at [SISSA](https://www.sissa.it/). I am a part of the Machine Learning and Systems Biology research unit led by [Guido Sanguinetti](https://datascience.sissa.it/person/11/guido-sanguinetti). Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Research Assistant in the [School of Industrial Engineering](https://engineering.purdue.edu/IE) at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/). I completed my PhD under the supervision of [Mario Ventresca](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~mventresca/index.php) on Generative Modeling of Networks in December 2019. I completed my bachelors in Production and Industrial Engineering from [IIT Delhi](http://www.iitd.ac.in/) in 2014, where I worked with [Makarand Kulkarni](http://web.iitd.ac.in/~mskulkarni/) for my bachelor's thesis.  

I am interested in developing conceptual, mathematical, and computational tools for modeling complex systems. My research interests include network science, machine learning, complex systems, algorithm design, simulation, multi-objective optimization, and mechanism design.
