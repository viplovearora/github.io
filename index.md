I am Viplove Arora, a Senior Research Scientist at [Pumpkinseed](https://www.linkedin.com/company/pumpkinseed/), working on developing ML methods for protein sequencing. Before this, I did postdoctoral research on machine learning in Bioinformatics in [The Theoretical and Scientific Data Science Group](https://datascience.sissa.it/) at [SISSA](https://www.sissa.it/). I was a part of the Machine Learning and Systems Biology research unit led by [Guido Sanguinetti](https://datascience.sissa.it/person/11/guido-sanguinetti). I earned my PhD under the guidance of [Mario Ventresca](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~mventresca/index.php), where we devised a **generative probabilistic model** for graphs that learns a mixture of distinct link creation processes. I completed my bachelor's in Production and Industrial Engineering from [IIT Delhi](http://www.iitd.ac.in/) in 2014.  

My expertise lies in Graph Machine Learning. At SISSA, I have applied GNNs to raw biological data (RNA-protein binding, multi-omics) creating graphs for novel Graph ML tasks like transfer learning and link weight prediction. More recently, I led a project to understand the effective capacity and generalization of neural networks through the lens of pruning, with implications for both traditional and large language models (LLMs). I am also co-supervising a PhD thesis on Continual Learning in neural networks using biologically plausible optimization algorithms.

<!-- I am interested in developing conceptual, mathematical, and computational tools for modeling complex systems. My research interests include network science, machine learning, complex systems, algorithm design, simulation, multi-objective optimization, and mechanism design. -->
