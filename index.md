I am Viplove Arora, postdoctoral researcher working on machine learning in Bioinformatics in [The Theoretical and Scientific Data Science Group](https://datascience.sissa.it/) at [SISSA](https://www.sissa.it/). I am a part of the Machine Learning and Systems Biology research unit led by [Guido Sanguinetti](https://datascience.sissa.it/person/11/guido-sanguinetti). Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Research Assistant in the [School of Industrial Engineering](https://engineering.purdue.edu/IE) at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/). I completed my PhD under the supervision of [Mario Ventresca](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~mventresca/index.php), where we developed a generative model for real-world graphs. I completed my bachelors in Production and Industrial Engineering from [IIT Delhi](http://www.iitd.ac.in/) in 2014, where I worked with [Makarand Kulkarni](https://www.me.iitb.ac.in/?q=faculty/Prof.%20Makarand.%20Shrikrishna.%20Kulkarni) for my bachelor's thesis.  

I am broadly interested in working on Graph ML and presently looking for opportunities in the San Francisco bay area. During my time at SISSA, I have worked on applying graph neural networks (GNNs) to novel ML tasks like transfer learning and link weight prediction to relevant problems in Bioinformatics. More recently, I started working on investigating the effective capacity and generalization of neural networks through the lens of pruning. I am also co-supervising a PhD thesis on Continual Learning using Direct Feedback Alignment.

<!-- I am interested in developing conceptual, mathematical, and computational tools for modeling complex systems. My research interests include network science, machine learning, complex systems, algorithm design, simulation, multi-objective optimization, and mechanism design. -->
